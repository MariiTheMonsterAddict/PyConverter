Just a small one off useless project to I wanted to do to get unrusty with python again

It might be useful to someone someday but I doubt it!

basic instructions coming soon once I get the usability figured out, 
might put some easter eggs throughout the script... who knowssss

#TODO Import save file functionality so the settings menu actually does something...
#TODO Finish the personal config setting 
#TODO make it so the program only displays the info you ask for in the config
#TODO default to showing all the values and asking for what keys to use only if there is no personalconfig
#TODO make it ask for the file name if there is no default set 
#TODO make it so it asks the user for what they want stripped out of the input
#TODO finish the program!
#TODO make it output to a txt file with some pretty formating for easy reading 
#TODO make a readme with some basic instructions
#TODO post to a repo on github!!
